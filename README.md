# Hey there 👋

I'm **Smit Shinde**, a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in backend development, data structures, and system fundamentals.

I focus on understanding how things work under the hood and building clean, reliable software. Most of my work is original and built step by step as part of my learning process.

This profile is a place where I share projects, experiments, and concepts I’m currently learning — no copy-paste tutorials, only hands-on practice.
