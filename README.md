👋 About Me

I’m Smit Shinde, a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate focused on building a strong foundation before specialization.

My current priority is mastering JavaScript from the ground up—understanding the language deeply rather than treating it as just a tool. Alongside this, I have started my DSA journey today, with the plan to apply data structures and algorithms using JavaScript once the language fundamentals are solid.

I have used backend-related tools during AI-assisted website building, which helped me understand application flow, but my learning path is now structured and fundamentals-first.

This GitHub profile reflects learning in progress, not inflated expertise.

🧠 Learning Philosophy

Master one language properly before moving ahead

Fundamentals > frameworks

Clarity over clever hacks

Consistent progress beats fast progress
